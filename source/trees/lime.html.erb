features: "Now rare, the indigenous limes once covered Britain from shining sea to sea — and how sweet the land must have smelt. Apart from the fragrance of its flowers, the aphids that feed on lime’s pleasing mid-green leaves secrete sweet, sugary honey-dew. A stately addition to locations from city street to country estate."
