features: "Weeping willow are average sized trees which  grow to a size between 30-50 feet. They’re famed for their elegant appearance. Their long, graceful branches “weep” into an arch, creating a round canopy that grazes the ground gently. They received their common name from the way that rain looks like tears when it's dripping off the curved branches. Their narrow leaves are light green on top, with silvery undersides until they turn yellow in autumn. The bark is rough, gray, and ridged. Yellow flowers bloom in late winter or spring"
